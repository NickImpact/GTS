# Major Note
* GTS now requires Sponge 7.4.0 or higher as to enforce a Log4j safe environment. If you are not yet updated,
the plugin will cause your server to forcibly crash on startup until you do so.

# Additions
* Added bid snipe handling, allowing auctions to change their time once bid on past a certain threshold (credits: 02Miki)
* Added login message to indicate you have items available in your stash (credits: ojcastillo)
* Added support for the following flatfile data save options: JSON, YAML, HOCON
* The selling command has been added back for quick no-UI operation (you're welcome)
* Added deliveries
  * Deliveries act as a system for awarding players items that might be for refunds or other reasons
* Added more admin controls
* Added maintenance mode
  * This allows for pushing specific components, or the entire plugin, into a safe mode where features of the plugin are temporarily disabled
  
# Changes
* Added language keys for admin "Delete and Return" operations that were accidentally missed (credits: ojcastillo)
* Threads will now sleep in busy-wait cycles rather than continuously iterate
* Items can now be disabled in favor of other entry types
  * Note: You might need to clean your database of item-based listings, as these will throw exceptions when trying to be deserialized if they exist with this feature enabled
* UI performance has been improved

# Fixes
* Fixed a duplication issue that could be caused from failed legacy data translation
* Fixed a duplication issue that could be triggered from NEI
* Fixed a case where items could lose a set of their stack size if the inventory was able to accept some but not all
* Fixed admin "delete and return" requests not returning if the player was offline
* Fixed admin "delete and return" requests nuking any and all active bids on an auction
* Fixed an assumed version tag with Sponge (This version check never considered future versions, and was frankly unnecessary)
*
