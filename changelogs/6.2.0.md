## Version Notes
* As an initial release for 1.16.5, this version will be considered a beta.

## Game Version
* Now targeting 1.16.5 (Sponge API 8)
  * Note: Due to different mappings, 6.2.0 will only support SpongeForge.
  * Note: Pending a fix in Sponge, console warnings will typically appear when opening a few of the menus. These are not
  errors on GTS's side, but rather an unimplemented section of Sponge awaiting support.
  * Future Plan: Whether its 1.17+, or still 1.16.5, GTS 7.0.0 will aim to be platform-agnostic. In other words, the
  plugin will target Sponge, Forge, Spigot, and Paper. Plan for this type of release is by end of year, but this time
  is not a guarantee

## Changes
* Updated to target Impactor 4.0.0
* Small API changes
* The side panel in the browser now actually has functionality, and provides filtering based on the type
* Due to issues with Sponge, live menu updating is now disabled.
* 1.12.2 Items do not transition to 1.16.5 sadly. This is due to the Sponge data type not providing data translators
for their own data in line with Minecraft's.

## Extensions
Reforged: Support for 9.0.5 (Would have been 9.0.0+) but they decided to change a class that didn't need changing, again
Reforged: In order for data to transfer correctly at all, the Reforged Mixins mod is temporarily required.
