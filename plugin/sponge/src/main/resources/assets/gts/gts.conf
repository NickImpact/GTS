#   |=> MariaDB (preferred over MySQL)
#   |=> PostgreSQL
#
#   |  Local databases - Databases which exist only locally

# local storage providers require no connection information. If you are using a local
# storage provider option, you can ignore this section

# - If enabled and configured, GTS will use the messaging service to inform other connected

# - If you decide to enable this feature, you should set "sync-minutes" to -1, as there is no need
#   for LuckPerms to poll the database for changes.
#
# - Possible options:
#   => pluginmsg Uses the plugin messaging channels to communicate with the proxy.
#                LuckPerms must be installed on your proxy & all connected servers backend servers.
#                Won't work if you have more than one proxy.
#   => redis     Uses Redis pub-sub to push changes. Your server connection info must be configured
#                below.
