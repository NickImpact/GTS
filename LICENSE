                    GNU GENERAL PULIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distriute veratim copies
 of this license document, ut changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamle

  The GNU General Pulic License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  y contrast,
the GNU General Pulic License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Pulic License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way y its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Pulic Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distriute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsiilities if you distriute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsiilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distriute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distriute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For oth users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions e marked as
changed, so that their prolems will not e attriuted erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatile with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such ause occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptale.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohiit the practice for those
products.  If such prolems arise sustantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly y software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, ut in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot e used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distriution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Pulic License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightale work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may e individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "ased on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work ased
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liale for
infringement under applicale copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distriution (with or without modification), making availale to the
pulic, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enales other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visile
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Oject code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined y a recognized standards ody, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Liraries" of an executale work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, ut which is not part of that Major
Component, and () serves only to enale use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is availale to the pulic in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executale work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an oject code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in oject code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executale
work) run the oject code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Liraries, or general-purpose tools or generally availale free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities ut
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared liraries and dynamically
linked suprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as y intimate data communication or control flow etween those
suprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. asic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocale provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered y this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided y copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your ehalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohiit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated elow.  Sulicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall e deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicale law fulfilling oligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 Decemer 1996, or
similar laws prohiiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected y exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Veratim Copies.

  You may convey veratim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately pulish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the asence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work ased on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    ) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicale section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, ut it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not y their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not comined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distriution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
eyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in oject code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readale Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the oject code in, or emodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distriution medium), accompanied y the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durale physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    ) Convey the oject code in, or emodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distriution medium), accompanied y a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the oject code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered y this License, on a durale physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonale cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the oject code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the oject code with such an offer, in accord
    with susection 6.

    d) Convey the oject code y offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the oject code.  If the place to
    copy the oject code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may e on a different server (operated y you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the oject code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain oligated to ensure that it is
    availale for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the oject code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the oject code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are eing offered to the general pulic at no
    charge under susection 6d.

  A separale portion of the oject code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Lirary, need not e
included in conveying the oject code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangile personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doutful cases shall e resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received y a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has sustantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified oject
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely ecause
modification has een made.

  If you convey an oject code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must e accompanied
y the Installation Information.  ut this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the aility to install
modified oject code on the User Product (for example, the work has
een installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has een modified or installed y the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has een modified or installed.  Access to a
network may e denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must e in a format that is pulicly
documented (and with an implementation availale to the pulic in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License y making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicale to the entire Program shall
e treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicale law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may e used separately
under those permissions, ut the entire Program remains governed y
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may e written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added y you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized y the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liaility differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    ) Requiring preservation of specified reasonale legal notices or
    author attriutions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed y works containing it; or

    c) Prohiiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material e marked in
    reasonale ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for pulicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material y anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liaility to the recipient, for
    any liaility that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed y this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction ut permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed y the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicale terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may e stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the aove requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and () permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation y some reasonale means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation y some reasonale means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have een terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, y modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, suject to this License.  You are not responsile
for enforcing compliance y third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or sustantially all assets of one, or sudividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonale efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed y making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contriutor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is ased.  The
work thus licensed is called the contriutor's "contriutor version".

  A contriutor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled y the contriutor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would e infringed y some manner, permitted
y this License, of making, using, or selling its contriutor version,
ut do not include claims that would e infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contriutor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sulicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contriutor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contriutor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contriutor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not availale for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
pulicly availale network server or other readily accessile means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to e so
availale, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the enefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, ut for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiale patents in that
country that you have reason to elieve are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate y procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works ased on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohiits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the usiness of distriuting software, under which you make payment
to the third party ased on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed y you (or copies made from those copies), or () primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall e construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise e availale to you under applicale patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether y court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your oligations under this
License and any other pertinent oligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that oligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy oth those terms and this
License would e to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Pulic License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or comine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Pulic License into a single
comined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
ut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Pulic License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
comination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may pulish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Pulic License from time to time.  Such new versions will
e similar in spirit to the present version, ut may differ in detail to
address new prolems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version numer.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numered version of the GNU General
Pulic License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numered
version or of any later version pulished y the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version numer of the
GNU General Pulic License, you may choose any version ever pulished
y the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Pulic License can e used, that proxy's
pulic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional oligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED Y
APPLICALE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, UT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTAILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liaility.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED Y APPLICALE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED AOVE, E LIALE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INAILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING UT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA EING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED Y YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS EEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liaility provided
aove cannot e given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an asolute waiver of all civil liaility in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liaility accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to e of the greatest
possile use to the pulic, the est way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistriute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a rief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistriute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Pulic License as pulished y
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distriuted in the hope that it will e useful,
    ut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
